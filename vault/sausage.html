        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>
            <br>
            Arrange 2 racks in middle and upper thirds of oven and preheat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line two
            10x15-inch baking pans with foil.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 2</b>
            <br>
            Toss bell peppers, onion, and tomatoes together in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil, balsamic vinegar,
            Italian seasoning, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. Transfer to one of the prepared pans.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 3</b>
            <br>
            Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 4</b>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, drizzle bread slices with remaining olive oil and sprinkle with remaining salt and black pepper.
            Arrange on the other prepared pan.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 5</b>
            <br>
            Remove the vegetables from the oven; push to one side of the pan. Add sausage to the exposed portion of the
            pan.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 6</b>
            <br>
            Roast until vegetables are tender and sausage is heated through, 10 to 15 minutes more, adding the pan with
            bread in the last 5 minutes of roasting time. Sprinkle vegetables and sausage with oregano and serve with
            bread.
