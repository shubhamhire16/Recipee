        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>22 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 slices fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>
            <br>
            Combine soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a small microwave-safe bowl; heat in the
            microwave on medium power for 1 minute, then stir. Heat again for 30 seconds, watching closely to prevent
            boiling.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 2</b>
            <br>
            Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish. Pour soy sauce mixture over top and set aside to marinate for 15
            minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 3</b>
            <br>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 4</b>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, remove chicken from marinade; transfer marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce
            heat to low and simmer until thick, about 1 minute. Set aside for basting.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Step 5</b>
            <br>
            Cook chicken on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until golden brown on all
            sides and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat
            thermometer inserted into the thickest piece should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
